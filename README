Dorking out with a foray into importing retrosheet data into GAE and trying my hand at building an API around that.
appcfg.py download_data --url=http://localhost:8080/remote_api --application=retrosheetapi --filename=test --kind=api_team
manage.py runserver localhost:8080
not sure why the /_ah/admin interface doesnt show entities
