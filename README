Dorking out with a foray into importing retrosheet data into GAE and trying my hand at building an API around that.

Notes for myself:
Importing data with import_data.py script to not be stuck with mapping things like this:  http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/uploadingdata.html
manage.py runserver localhost:8080
- import data to local store with import_data script
- create script to export all entity kinds from local store:
  - have to specify kind (find a way to grab those fellas)
  appcfg.py download_data --url=http://localhost:8080/remote_api --application=retrosheetapi --filename=test --kind=api_team

not sure why the /_ah/admin interface doesnt show entities when booted with dev_appserver, but works as expected with django biz
